## Software Testing Mini Campaign

To run the Java files, go to Compare.java and click on "Run" at the main() function.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
